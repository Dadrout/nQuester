# Fixes Summary - Mentor Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Diana Mentor Not Working
**Problem**: Diana mentor was not included in the mentor locations list, so she couldn't be accessed.

**Fix**: 
- Added Diana to the mentors list in `mentor_locations.py`
- Added Tamyrlan to the mentors list as well for completeness

**Files Changed**:
- `mentor_locations.py`: Added Diana and Tamyrlan to the mentors list

### 2. Shoqan's Specialization Wrong
**Problem**: Shoqan was listed as "Mobile" developer but should be "Frontend" developer.

**Fix**:
- Changed Shoqan's specialization from "Mobile" to "Frontend" in `mentor_locations.py`
- Updated Shoqan's quest to focus on React/JavaScript debugging instead of mobile development

**Files Changed**:
- `mentor_locations.py`: Changed Shoqan's specialty from "Mobile" to "Frontend"
- `quest_manager.py`: Updated quest title, dialogue, and minigame to focus on frontend
- `level.py`: Updated quest setup dialogue to match frontend focus

### 3. Shoqan's Quest Bugs
**Problem**: Shoqan's quest was using mobile_debug minigame which was inappropriate for frontend development.

**Fix**:
- Changed Shoqan's quest to use `react_debug` minigame instead of `mobile_debug`
- Updated all dialogue and feedback to reflect frontend/React focus
- The react_debug minigame was already properly implemented

**Files Changed**:
- `quest_manager.py`: Changed minigame_id from "mobile_debug" to "react_debug"
- Updated all dialogue and user feedback to reflect React/JavaScript focus

## Current Status

✅ **Diana Mentor**: Now properly included in mentor locations and can be accessed
✅ **Shoqan Mentor**: Specialization corrected to "Frontend" and quest updated to use appropriate minigame
✅ **Quest Functionality**: All minigames are properly implemented and working

## Testing

The fixes ensure that:
1. Diana mentor can be found and interacted with on the main map
2. Shoqan mentor now has the correct specialization (Frontend)
3. Shoqan's quest uses the appropriate React debugging minigame
4. All quests have proper dialogue and feedback messages

## Notes

- The `mobile_debug` minigame still exists and can be used by other mentors if needed
- The `react_debug` minigame was already properly implemented and working
- All mentor locations are now properly set up for all mentors including Diana and Tamyrlan
